# 📊 ABCRummy Production Readiness Report

## 🏁 Current Verification Status
- **End-to-End Simulation**: SUCCESS (2 Players, multi-browser)
- **Game Engine**: 13-Card Indian Rummy (Verified)
- **Betting System**: Fixed Bet with 10% House Rake (Verified)

## 🚧 Critical Production Blockers
1. **Financial Atomicity**: Current wallet updates are not wrapped in ACID transactions.
2. **Persistence**: Game state is lost if the API process restarts.
3. **Scale**: Socket.io is currently limited to a single CPU core/server instance.

## 📈 Roadmap for "Unlimited Players"

### 1. Database & Transactions (The "Money" Pillar)
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to **PostgreSQL**.
- [ ] Implement **Prisma Transactions** for Payouts.
- [ ] Add a `WalletAudit` table to track every single rupee movement.

### 2. Scalable Real-time (The "Socket" Pillar)
- [ ] Implement **Redis Adapter** for Socket.io.
- [ ] Move active game states from `Map<string, RummyTable>` to **Redis/PostgreSQL**.
- [ ] Enable horizontal scaling (AWS ECS or Kubernetes).

### 3. Matchmaking (The "UX" Pillar)
- [ ] Implement a **Global Queue** for different bet amounts (₹10, ₹50, ₹100).
- [ ] Add **Reconnection Logic**: If a player's app crashes, they should rejoin the active game automatically on restart.
- [ ] Automated **Bot Fillers**: (Optional) Allow bots to join tables if real players aren't found in 30 seconds.
