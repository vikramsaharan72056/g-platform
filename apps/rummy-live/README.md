# Rummy Live (Isolated New App)

This is a completely separate app stack from the existing platform.

Folders:
- api: real-time rummy backend (Socket + REST)
- admin: table operations dashboard
- mobile: player client app
- docs: planning and technical docs

Rule:
- Existing app under `packages/` remains untouched.
